# 3D-Engine
A 3D Graphics engine made in C++, created from scratch (No OpenGL). Only external code used is the SDL library for window management. None of the models or textures were created by me. Information for this project came from 'Mathematics for 3D Game Programming and Computer Graphics' by Eric Lengyel, and the Youtube series '3D Fundamentals' by ChiliTomatoNoodle.
